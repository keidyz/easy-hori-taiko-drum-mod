This is a guide that will allow you to effectively apply a sensitivity mod to your Taiko no Tatsujin drum.
Most guides out there require rubber sheets and cork or wood while this guide will only require common household items.

The drum used in this mod guide is the original Hori Taiko no Tatsujin switch drum but as long as the mechanism is the same- other drums should be moddable the same way.

Requirements:
- 2 sheets of paper
- electrical tape
- Phillips screwdriver to remove 5 of the drum's outer screws
- pliers (completely optional if you're fine with hurting your hands)

WIP - Need to add pictures and such too
