This is a guide that will allow you to effectively apply a sensitivity mod to your Taiko no Tatsujin drum.
Most guides out there require rubber sheets and cork or wood while this guide will only require common household items.

Requirements:
- 2 sheets of paper
- electrical tape
- Phillips screwdriver to remove 5 of the drum's outer screws
- pliers (completely optional if you're fine with hurting your hands)

WIP - Need to add pictures and such too
